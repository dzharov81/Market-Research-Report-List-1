<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laboratory Leak Tester Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hammering Method</li><li>Ultrasound</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The laboratory leak tester market includes two types: the hammering method and the ultrasound method. The hammering method involves striking an object to detect any leaks or defects in its structure. It relies on the principle that a damaged or weak area will produce a different sound when hit. On the other hand, the ultrasound method utilizes sound waves at high frequencies to identify any leaks or discontinuities in a material. It works on the principle that a leak will release a distinct ultrasonic signal that can be detected by specialized equipment.</p></p>
