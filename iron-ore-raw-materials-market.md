<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Iron Ore Raw Materials Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Concentrates</li><li>Direct-shipping Ores</li><li>Sinter Ores</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The iron ore raw materials market is divided into three main types:</p><p>1. Concentrates: These are produced by crushing and grinding large iron ore rocks. Concentrates typically have a higher iron content and are used in the production of steel through the blast furnace process.</p><p>2. Direct-shipping Ores: These are extracted from iron ore deposits and can be shipped directly to steel mills without the need for any further processing. They usually have lower iron content than concentrates.</p><p>3. Sinter Ores: These are intermediate products produced by agglomerating fine iron ore particles into a porous mass. Sinter ores are commonly used as a feedstock in the blast furnace process for steel production.</p></p>
