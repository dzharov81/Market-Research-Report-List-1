<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cord-end Ferrules Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Insulated</li><li>Non-insulated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cord-end ferrules are small metal or plastic tubes that are crimped onto the end of electrical cords to provide a secure connection. They come in two main types: insulated and non-insulated. Insulated ferrules have a plastic coating that provides electrical insulation and prevents the wires from touching each other, reducing the risk of short circuits and electrical accidents. Non-insulated ferrules, on the other hand, do not have this coating and are generally used in applications where electrical insulation is not necessary. Both types serve the purpose of enhancing the connection and reliability of electrical cords.</p></p>
