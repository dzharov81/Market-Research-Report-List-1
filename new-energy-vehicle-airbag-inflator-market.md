<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The New Energy Vehicle Airbag Inflator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pyrotechnic Inflator</li><li>Stored Gas Inflator</li><li>Hybrid Inflator</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The New Energy Vehicle Airbag Inflator market consists of three types: Pyrotechnic Inflator, Stored Gas Inflator, and Hybrid Inflator. Pyrotechnic Inflators utilize an explosive charge to rapidly generate gas and inflate the airbag. Stored Gas Inflators store compressed gas in a canister, which is released to inflate the airbag during a collision. Hybrid Inflators combine both pyrotechnic and stored gas technologies to provide a more efficient and responsive inflation. These different types offer distinct advantages and options for manufacturers of new energy vehicles.</p></p>
