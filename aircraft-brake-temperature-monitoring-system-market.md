<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Brake Temperature Monitoring System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-contact</li><li>Contact</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Aircraft Brake Temperature Monitoring System Market includes two types: Non-contact and Contact systems. Non-contact systems monitor the brake temperature without physical contact with the brakes, utilizing infrared sensors to capture temperature readings. This type offers advantages such as faster response time and reduced wear and tear. On the other hand, Contact systems require direct physical contact with the brakes to measure temperature using thermocouples or strain gauges. While contact systems provide accurate measurements, they may require additional maintenance and have higher costs associated with sensor replacement. Both types cater to the specific needs and preferences of different aircraft operators.</p></p>
