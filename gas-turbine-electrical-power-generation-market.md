<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas Turbine Electrical Power Generation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT)</li><li>Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Gas Turbine Electrical Power Generation Market includes two major types: Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) and Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT). In OCGT, natural gas is burned in a combustion chamber, and the hot gases are directly used to drive a turbine, producing electricity. On the other hand, CCGT involves the use of a gas turbine and a steam turbine. The hot gases from the gas turbine are then used to produce steam, which drives the steam turbine to generate additional electricity. CCGT offers higher efficiency and lower emissions compared to OCGT.</p></p>
