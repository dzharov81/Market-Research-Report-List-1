<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bio-lubricants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plant-based</li><li>Animal-based</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Bio-lubricants are categorized into two major types: plant-based and animal-based. Plant-based bio-lubricants are derived from vegetable oils such as soybean, rapeseed, sunflower, and palm. These oils possess excellent lubricating properties and are considered environmentally friendly due to their biodegradability and low toxicity. Animal-based bio-lubricants, on the other hand, are obtained from animal fats and oils like beef tallow, pork lard, and poultry fat. These lubricants offer similar advantages as plant-based ones, but their production may have ethical concerns related to animal welfare.</p></p>
