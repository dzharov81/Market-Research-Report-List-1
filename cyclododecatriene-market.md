<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cyclododecatriene Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>TTT</li><li>TTC</li><li>TCC</li><li>CCC</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Cyclododecatriene (CDT) market can be categorized into four types: TTT, TTC, TCC, and CCC. In the TTT market, all three double bonds of CDT remain intact during the polymerization process, resulting in a trimer with three double bonds. The TTC market involves the hydrogenation of one double bond, leaving the other two intact. The TCC market refers to the scenario where two double bonds are hydrogenated, while one remains as it is. Lastly, in the CCC market, all three double bonds are hydrogenated, resulting in a completely saturated product.</p></p>
