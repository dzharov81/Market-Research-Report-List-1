<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Passenger Car Brake Fluids Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>DOT 3</li><li>DOT 4</li><li>DOT 5</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Passenger car brake fluids are classified into three types based on their performance standards: DOT 3, DOT 4, and DOT 5. DOT 3 brake fluid is a glycol-based fluid suitable for most conventional braking systems, offering good performance and affordability. DOT 4 brake fluid has a higher boiling point than DOT 3, making it suitable for more demanding braking systems, such as those in heavy vehicles or high-performance cars. DOT 5 brake fluid, on the other hand, is silicone-based and primarily used in specialized applications where compatibility with rubber components and resistance to moisture are crucial.</p></p>
