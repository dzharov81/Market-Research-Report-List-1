<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Twin Turbochargers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tandem Turbo</li><li>Parallel Turbo</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Automotive twin turbochargers are a type of forced induction system used in vehicles to increase power output. Tandem turbochargers, also known as sequential or variable-geometry turbos, work in a series where smaller turbos spool up quickly at low engine speeds and larger ones engage at higher speeds to provide a continuous power boost. On the other hand, parallel turbochargers, also called twin-scroll or parallel twin turbos, use two identical turbos working simultaneously to increase overall power. Both systems aim to improve engine performance by increasing air intake and compression.</p></p>
