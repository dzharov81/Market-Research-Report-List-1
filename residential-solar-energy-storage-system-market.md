<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Residential Solar Energy Storage System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lead-acid Battery</li><li>Li-ion Battery</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The residential solar energy storage system market offers two main types of batteries - lead-acid and lithium-ion. Lead-acid batteries, the traditional choice, are affordable and have a longer life span, making them suitable for long-term energy storage. Lithium-ion batteries, on the other hand, are more expensive but provide higher energy density and a faster charging rate. They are ideal for shorter-term energy storage and are commonly used in portable electronics. Both types serve the purpose of storing excess solar energy generated by residential solar panels for later use, reducing dependence on the grid and saving costs.</p></p>
