<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Single Dose Radiotherapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Beam Radiotherapy</li><li>Internal Beam Radiotherapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single dose radiotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that delivers radiation directly to the tumor site in a single session. External beam radiotherapy involves the use of high-energy X-rays or proton beams delivered externally to the patient's body. It is commonly used to treat various types of cancer. Internal beam radiotherapy, also known as brachytherapy, involves placing radioactive sources inside or near the tumor to deliver radiation directly to the cancer cells. This approach is often used for localized cancers, such as prostate or cervical cancer. Both types of radiotherapy aim to destroy cancer cells while minimizing harm to surrounding healthy tissues.</p></p>
