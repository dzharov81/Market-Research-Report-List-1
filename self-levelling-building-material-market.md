<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-levelling Building Material Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Underlayment</li><li>Toppings</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Self-leveling building materials are used in construction to create a flat and even surface on floors or other structures. Underlayment is a type of self-leveling material that is applied directly over the subfloor to provide a smooth base for further flooring installation. It helps to correct imperfections and unevenness in the existing surface. On the other hand, toppings are self-leveling materials applied as a finishing layer on top of the underlayment to achieve the desired final appearance. Toppings can be decorative or functional, providing durability and enhanced aesthetics to the flooring.</p></p>
