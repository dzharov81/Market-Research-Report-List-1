<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Alexandrite Rod Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Czochralski Method</li><li>Float-Zone Method</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Alexandrite Rod market can be categorized into two types based on the manufacturing methods employed. The Czochralski Method involves melting high-purity alexandrite powder in a crucible, and then slowly drawing a single crystal rod from the melt. This method allows for larger crystal diameters. On the other hand, the Float-Zone Method manufactures alexandrite rods by melting the powder on a rotating silicon rod, forming smaller diameter crystals. Both methods offer their own advantages and are utilized in different applications within the market.</p></p>
