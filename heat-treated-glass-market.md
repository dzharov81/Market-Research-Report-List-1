<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heat Treated Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heat Stengthened Glass</li><li>Fully Tempered Glass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Heat treated glass refers to a type of glass that undergoes a process of heating followed by rapid cooling to increase its strength and durability. Heat-strengthened glass is heated to a lower temperature than fully tempered glass, resulting in improved resistance to thermal stress. Fully tempered glass, on the other hand, is heated to a higher temperature and cooled rapidly, making it four to five times stronger than regular glass and less likely to break. Both types of glass find applications in various industries, including construction and automotive, due to their increased strength and safety features.</p></p>
