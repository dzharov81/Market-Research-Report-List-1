<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-Reflective Window Film Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Clear</li><li>Dyed</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Non-reflective window film is available in two main types: clear and dyed. Clear window film is transparent and does not alter the appearance of the window. It is designed to block harmful UV rays and reduce glare while maintaining the original view. On the other hand, dyed window film contains a layer of colored dye that can offer enhanced privacy and aesthetics. This type of film absorbs solar heat and reduces glare, making it particularly suitable for residential or commercial applications. Both clear and dyed window films provide similar benefits but differ in their appearance and level of privacy offered.</p></p>
