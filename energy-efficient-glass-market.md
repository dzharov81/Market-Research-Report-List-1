<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Energy Efficient Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hard Coat</li><li>Soft Coat</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Energy efficient glass is categorized into two main types: hard coat and soft coat. Hard coat glass refers to a type of energy efficient glass where a layer of tin oxide is applied directly onto the glass surface, making it more durable and resistant to scratching. On the other hand, soft coat glass consists of multiple thin layers of metallic coatings deposited on the glass surface during a vacuum process, which increases energy efficiency by reflecting heat back into the room. These two types of energy efficient glass offer different benefits based on their applications and durability.</p></p>
