<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electronic Intelligent Tourniquet Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Port</li><li>Dual Port</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Electronic Intelligent Tourniquet (EIT) market consists of two types: Single Port and Dual Port. A Single Port EIT is equipped with one port that allows for the inflow and outflow of fluids, while a Dual Port EIT has two ports that independently control inflow and outflow. Both types are used in medical procedures to temporarily restrict blood flow to a specific area, aiding in surgeries and reducing blood loss. Single Port EITs are simpler in design, while Dual Port EITs offer more control and flexibility in managing blood flow during procedures.</p></p>
