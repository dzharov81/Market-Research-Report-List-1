<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mercury Removal Carbon Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Powdery</li><li>Granular</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Mercury removal carbon refers to the use of carbon-based materials to remove mercury from gases or liquids. There are two types of carbon markets based on the physical form of the carbon material used. Powdery carbon market involves the use of finely powdered carbon materials, which are usually more reactive and have a larger surface area. On the other hand, granular carbon market uses larger granules of carbon, which are typically less reactive but have a longer lifespan due to their slower wear rate. These different market types cater to varying demands and specific applications of mercury removal.</p></p>
