<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The UV Resistant Epoxy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent Based</li><li>Water Based</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The UV resistant epoxy market is segmented into two main types: solvent-based and water-based. Solvent-based epoxy uses organic solvents as a base to dissolve the epoxy resins and aids in the application process. It offers excellent adhesion, hardness, and durability but releases harmful volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during curing. On the other hand, water-based epoxy uses water as a solvent, resulting in a more environmentally friendly and low VOC option. It offers similar properties as solvent-based epoxy but requires longer curing time and may have reduced hardness.</p></p>
