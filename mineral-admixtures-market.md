<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mineral Admixtures Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cementitious Materials</li><li>Pozzolans</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Mineral admixtures are materials added to concrete mixtures to improve certain properties. Cementitious materials, one type of mineral admixture, refer to substances that can react with water to form cementing compounds. These materials, such as fly ash and slag, enhance strength and durability of concrete. Pozzolans, another type of mineral admixture, are finely-ground materials that do not have cementing properties on their own but can react with calcium hydroxide in the presence of water to form cementitious compounds. This improves the workability and reduces heat generation in concrete.</p></p>
