<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyester Tire Cord Fabrics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dipped</li><li>Undipped</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyester tire cord fabrics can be classified into two types: dipped and undipped. Dipped tire cord fabrics undergo a process where they are immersed in a rubber compound, enhancing their strength and durability. This dipping process ensures the tire cords are thoroughly coated, providing excellent adhesion with the rubber. On the other hand, undipped tire cord fabrics are not subjected to this dipping process, remaining uncoated. Consequently, undipped fabrics may offer higher air permeability but are generally less strong and durable compared to their dipped counterparts.</p></p>
