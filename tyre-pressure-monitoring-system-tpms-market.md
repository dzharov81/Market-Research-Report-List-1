<p><h1>Tyre Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) Market Provides Detailed Segmentation of this Market based on Type, Application, and Region and Forecast for the Period from 2023 - 2030</h1></p><p><strong>Market Overview and Report Coverage</strong></p>
<p><p>Tyre Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) is an electronic system that is designed to monitor the air pressure inside the tires of vehicles. It consists of sensors, a display unit, and a warning system. The sensors are attached to the valves of the tires and continuously monitor the pressure. If the pressure drops below a certain threshold, the system sends a warning signal to the display unit, alerting the driver to the low pressure.</p><p>The future outlook for the TPMS market is promising. The increasing demand for safety features in vehicles, coupled with strict government regulations regarding vehicle safety, is expected to drive the growth of the TPMS market. The system not only enhances safety by detecting and alerting drivers to low tire pressure, but it also improves fuel efficiency and reduces carbon emissions.</p><p>Additionally, the growing trend of connected cars and the integration of TPMS with other vehicle safety systems, such as stability control and anti-lock braking systems, is expected to further fuel the market growth. The advancements in technology, such as wireless TPMS sensors and integration with smartphones, are also expected to contribute to the market growth.</p><p>According to the given data, the TPMS market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 14.6% during the forecasted period. This signifies a strong growth trajectory for the market. The market is likely to witness increased adoption of TPMS in both passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles. Additionally, the aftermarket segment is expected to play a significant role in the market growth as more vehicle owners are retrofitting their vehicles with TPMS systems.</p><p>Overall, the future outlook for the TPMS market is positive, driven by the increasing demand for safety features, government regulations, and technological advancements.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tyre Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct TPMS</li><li>Indirect TPMS</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Tyre Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) is a technology used to monitor the air pressure inside tyres and inform drivers about any deviations from the recommended levels. There are two types of TPMS systems available in the market. Direct TPMS uses sensors positioned inside each tyre to provide real-time pressure data to the driver. Indirect TPMS, on the other hand, works by monitoring wheel rotation speeds to detect under-inflated tyres based on variations in the rolling diameter. Both types aim to enhance safety, increase fuel efficiency, and improve overall tyre performance.</p></p>
