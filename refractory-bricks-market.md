<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Refractory Bricks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unshaped (Monolithic Refractories)</li><li>Shaped</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Refractory bricks are classified into two major types: unshaped (monolithic refractories) and shaped. Unshaped refractories, also known as monolithic refractories, are materials that are not shaped into bricks before installation. They are prepared and applied in a semi-liquid or plastic state using various techniques such as casting, ramming, or gunning. On the other hand, shaped refractory bricks are made into specific shapes before being used. They are manufactured using molds and are available in various forms, such as bricks, tiles, sleeves, and blocks.</p></p>
