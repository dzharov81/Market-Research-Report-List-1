<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Grey and Ductile Iron Castings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vertical Molding</li><li>Horizontal Molding</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Grey iron castings are made by pouring molten iron into a mold made from sand. This method allows for flexibility in shape and size. Vertical molding in grey iron castings refers to the process of pouring the molten iron into a vertical mold, where gravity helps in filling the mold. Ductile iron castings are made in a similar way, but the iron is treated with magnesium to make it more flexible. Horizontal molding in ductile iron castings refers to pouring the molten iron into a horizontal mold, which is then closed and compacted using pressure.</p></p>
