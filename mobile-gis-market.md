<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mobile GIS Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-Promise</li><li>On-Cloud</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The mobile GIS market consists of two main types: On-Premise and On-Cloud. On-Premise refers to the deployment of GIS software within an organization's internal infrastructure, meaning the software and data are hosted on the organization's own servers. This offers greater control and security but requires maintenance and updates. On-Cloud, on the other hand, involves accessing GIS software and data via the internet from a third-party provider's servers. This provides convenience and scalability, avoiding the need for internal infrastructure, but relies on the provider's security measures.</p></p>
