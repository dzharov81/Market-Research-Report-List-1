<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The IoT Smart Photoelectric Proximity Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Through-Beam Sensors</li><li>Retro-Reflective Sensors</li><li>Diffuse Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The IoT smart photoelectric proximity sensors market is divided into three types: through-beam sensors, retro-reflective sensors, and diffuse sensors. Through-beam sensors emit a beam of light from one unit to another, and when an object interrupts the beam, it triggers an action. Retro-reflective sensors have a receiver and a reflector, which bounces the emitted light back to the receiver. These sensors detect objects when the reflected light is interrupted. Diffuse sensors emit light and detect objects by measuring the intensity of the reflected light.</p></p>
