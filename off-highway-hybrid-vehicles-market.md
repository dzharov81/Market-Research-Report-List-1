<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Off-Highway Hybrid Vehicles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Series Hybrid</li><li>Parallel Hybrid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Off-Highway Hybrid Vehicles are broadly classified into two types: Series Hybrid and Parallel Hybrid. In a Series Hybrid, the engine is used solely to generate electricity, which is then stored in a battery to power an electric motor that propels the vehicle. This allows for optimal engine efficiency since it always operates at its most fuel-efficient speed. Conversely, a Parallel Hybrid utilizes both the engine and an electric motor to power the vehicle simultaneously. This flexibility allows the vehicle to adapt to varying load demands and maximize overall fuel efficiency.</p></p>
