<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Positive Expiratory Pressure (PEP) Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Pressure PEP (26-102cm H2O) Devices</li><li>Low Pressure PEP (5-20cm H2O) Devices</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Positive Expiratory Pressure (PEP) devices are used in respiratory therapy to improve lung function and treat various respiratory conditions. High Pressure PEP devices provide a range of 26-102cm H2O pressure, allowing for deeper lung expansion and increased airway clearance. On the other hand, Low Pressure PEP devices offer a pressure range of 5-20cm H2O, promoting milder lung expansion and lower airway resistance. Both types of PEP devices are recommended based on individual patient needs and can aid in improving respiratory capacity and maintaining airway hygiene.</p></p>
